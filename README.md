# Sliding-Tile-Puzzle

The Sliding Tile Puzzle is a puzzle in which you have to slide four white tiles to the right of the four black tiles. With one empty space, tiles can jump over 1,2,3, or 4 tiles. However, the bigger
the jump, the more that path costs. I used A* search and various different heuristics to solve this puzzle in order to get the best balance between path cost and heuristic value. The output
has two different solution, each with the different version of the heuristic I choose. The heuristics I choose were Manhattan Distance and distance from goal state.
